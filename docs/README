The documentation for Brandy consists of the following files:

basic           This is a brief introduction to Basic VI.

ChangeLog       A more detailed list of changes and bug fixes
                beginning with V1.21.0.

compiling       Instructions for compiling the program under
                various operating systems.

Config          This contains details on the configuration file that sets
                certain defaults when running Matrix Brandy.

graphics        This contains notes on the program's graphics
                support.

history         A list of changes and bug fixes in the different
                versions of the program.

internals       This gives a high level view of the interpreter's
                internals. It is not a line-by-line account of
                how it works but shows how the various components
                fit together.

messages        This file describes all the error messages that the
                interpreter can produce and what they mean.

Mode7           This contains notes on the program's Mode 7 Teletext
                support.

networking      This contains some notes on the implementation of
                network connectivity that was added in V1.21.6.

RISC-OS         This contains some notes on how the RISC OS build differs.

use             This describes how to use the interpreter and
                lists the differences between it and Acorn's
                interpreter and its limitations.

Brandy implements Basic VI, the the 64-bit floating-point mathematics
variant of the dialect of Basic that Acorn Computers supplied with their
ranges of desktop computers that use the ARM processor such as the
Archimedes and RiscPC. Basic V and VI are an extended version of BBC BASIC.
This was the BASIC version used on the BBC Micro that Acorn made during the
early 1980s.

There is some very useful documentation for the BBC Micro available on the
Internet. One very good site is 'The BBC Lives!' at:

        http://archive.retro-kit.co.uk/bbc.nvg.org/

The best manual to look at is the BBC User's Guide. It is useful in that it
gives a lot of background information on BBC BASIC and the environment in
which it runs. It should help in understanding this interpreter better.
