Matrix Brandy on RISC OS
========================

The following documents are not included in the RISC OS distribution, due to
the differences in the implementation:

compiling.txt:  Excluded because the process will vary depending on which
                compiler is used, and whether cross-compiling.

graphics.txt:   Matrix Brandy offers no internal graphics support on RISC OS,
                instead the VDU codes are passed through to the underlying OS.
                *REFRESH and other commands that interact with the SDL layer,
                thus, are recognised but do nothing.  User-defined screen modes
                are not available.

Mode7.txt:      As with graphics, MODE 7 support is implemented by RISC OS,
                rather than in Matrix Brandy. Thus the OSWORDs to read and
                write the teletext font are not available, nor are the
                facilities to change the SAA505x code page or black as a colour
                on older RISC OS versions.

osbyte.txt:     OSBYTE is passed through to RISC OS to handle, no emulation
                is offered by Matrix Brandy.
